I have had the fortune of being able to visit Europe on 3 occasions over
the last 5 years. I went to London and Paris in 2016. It was my first
time setting foot on European soil and I loved it. In 2018 I went to
Italy and couldn't get enough of the food or the sights. In 2019 I
went to Scotland with my dad and sister. We got to play golf at St.
Andrews which is the birthplace of golf. We got to visit many Scotch
distilleries. It has been great.
